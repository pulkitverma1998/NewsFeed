# NewsFeed

The News feed app gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you. 

This project combines various ideas and skills. They include:

1. Connecting to an API
2. Parsing the response of the API
3. Handling error cases gracefully
4. Updating information regularly
5. Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
